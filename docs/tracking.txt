11/4/20
  Changed 
    profitPctTrigger to == quitMaxProfit
    making this change since the original "algorithmTakeProfit" didn't work very well
    now that using average volume works well, see how it works with the "quitMaxProfit" value
    which is greater than the quicker algo using "profitPctTrigger"
  
  Changed    
    setProfitTarget()
      removed dividing profit target
      
      first test showed improvement
